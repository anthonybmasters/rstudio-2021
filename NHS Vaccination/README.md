## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is to process the NHS vaccination data, principally for England.
The first project looks at wrangling data out of the weekly online spreadsheet, to produce a vaccine coverage graph by different age groups and denominators.
The second code produces a graph comparing population statistics and a different graph of vaccine coverage.
