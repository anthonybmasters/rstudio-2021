## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is to create alternate versions of graphs in Public Health England weekly reports.
This code creates a small multiples graph of weekly hospital admissions by English region.

## Data source
I use an amended version of the Public Health England week 8 (2021) surveillance report:
- Public Health England: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964734/Weekly_Influenza_and_COVID19_report_data_W8.xlsx

## R Markdown
There is also a page to view, containing the graph:
