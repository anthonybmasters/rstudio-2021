## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is to draw an employment time series using the Office for National beta API.
With that series, I then create a graph.

## Data sources
The code uses statistics from two sources:
- Beta application programme interface: https://developer.ons.gov.uk/
- A02 SA: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/employmentunemploymentandeconomicinactivityforpeopleaged16andoverandagedfrom16to64seasonallyadjusteda02sa

## R Markdown
There is also an R Markdown page to view:
