## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is create miscellaneous data visualisations.
The first project relates to the odds of one in 10,000 and one in 100,000. The second project was simulating UK pub industry losses in terms of beer pints per adult (with distributional assumptions). The third project was for two graphs relating to vaccine coverage and effectiveness. The fourth project is for a graph of expected deaths in a synthetic cohort by age, sex, and nation in the UK (2017-19).
