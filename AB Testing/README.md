## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is to compare different uncertainty intervals for an A/B test.
It also produces a 'dot' graph representing a posterior distribution.

## R Packages
I use the following R packages:
- Wickham H (2019). tidyverse: Easily Install and Load the 'tidyverse'. R package version: 1.3.0, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html
- Kay M (2020). tidybayes: Tidy Data and 'Geoms' for Bayesian Models. R package version 2.3.1, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidybayes/index.html
