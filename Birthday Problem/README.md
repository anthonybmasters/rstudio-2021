## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is to simulate probabilities for the birthday problem using historical births data.

## Data sources
The historical births data comes from the Office for National Statistics:
- Office for National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/howpopularisyourbirthday/2015-12-18

I also adapt code from David Robinson's article:
- Variance Explained: http://varianceexplained.org/r/birthday-problem/
