## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to create graphs comparing two death measures.
The first measure is Office for National Statistics death registrations involving COVID-19.
The second measure is confirmed deaths from Public Health England. Outside of Wales, these are deaths within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
