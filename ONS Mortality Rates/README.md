## Purpose
The first R code script creates two graphs, concerning death registrations and mortality rates.
This is for England and Wales, between 1900 and 2020.
The 2020 figures are provisional.

The second file produces graphs on age-standardised mortality rates.

## Data source
The Office for National Statistics produced an ad hoc spreadsheet. I have adapted this spreadsheet.
- Office for National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12735annualdeathsandmortalityrates1938to2020provisional

## Packages
For create a 'joined' graph, I use Thomas Lin Pederson's patchwork package.

I also use Prof Matthew Kay's ggdist package:
